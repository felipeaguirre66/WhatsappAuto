# Automate Whatsapp messages with Selenium.

## Usage:
1. Pull this repository.
2. Complete the "receptores" file with the following data: name of receptor, phone number, exact date to send the message (follow the format), message ("RECEPTOR_WP" will be replaced with the value in the first column), pdf's name if wanted, images name if wanted, videos name if wanted.
3. Set the value on the first cell (navegacion_con_headers) in False if you do not want to see what the bot is doing.
4. Run the code
5. Autenticate with Whatsapp using the QR (a screenshot is also created)
6. An "informe.txt" file will be created on which every message will be documented.
